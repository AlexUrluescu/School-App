**A Legacy of Excellence**

Audi's journey began in 1909 when August Horch founded the company, initially named after himself. However, due to trademark conflicts, the name was changed to Audi, which is Latin for "hear." This name encapsulated the brand's philosophy of listening to the needs of its customers and responding with cutting-edge innovations.

**Innovation as a Driving Force**

One of Audi's most notable contributions to the automotive world is the introduction of quattro all-wheel drive technology in 1980. This revolutionary system transformed the industry by enhancing traction, stability, and overall performance in various road conditions. It became a hallmark feature, setting Audi apart from its competitors. 

Audi also played a pivotal role in the development of lightweight construction techniques, using materials like aluminum and carbon fiber-reinforced composites. This commitment to weight reduction not only improved fuel efficiency but also enhanced the agility and handling of Audi vehicles.
